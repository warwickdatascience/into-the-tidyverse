## Getting Started

### About the Course

'Into the Tidyverse' does exactly what it says on the tin. This is an intensive 5-week course which aims to take someone from a coding-zero to tidyverse-hero in as little time as possible. Each session is composed of a rapid-fire presentation introducing different elements of the tidyverse as well as an exercise sheet to help consolidate the ideas presented in the slideshow.

### Setup Guide

This course will use an editor called RStudio. You have two options:

1. Download and install first [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and then [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/) on your local machine
2. Sign up for [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/)

I would advise the former if you have install rights on your computer. It is slightly more faffy to setup than the latter option but will be more stable in the long-run due to the strict usage limits of RStudio Cloud. If you have any trouble with this, [give me a shout](#getting-help).

### Importing Datasets

To import a dataset from this repository, you will first need to download it. You can do this by clicking on one of the data links above. Then select the file of interest. You should then be taken to a page showing a preview of the file. Select `raw` from the top menu. This will open a pure text version of the file. Right-click or use `crtl-S` to save the file to someone on your hard drive.

You can then import this into R by setting your working directory to either the folder containing the file or a directory containing it and then specifying the correct relative path. 

If you are use RStudio cloud, you will need to open the `Files` panel and select `upload` to add the file to your workspace.

### Issue Reporting

The WDSS team have put their heart and soul (and some hundreds of hours) into producing the material in this course. After devoting that much energy, we want the resources to as perfect as possible. For that reason, if you come across any issue (spelling/grammar mistake, incorrect code, confusing points), no matter how small, please report it [here](https://github.com/warwickdatasciencesociety/into-the-tidyverse/issues). It only takes a few moments and we'll massively appreciate it!

## Accessing Resources

### Resource List

The content is the course is focused around two main streams, teaching sessions and homework sheets. The teaching sessions are designed to be rapid and dense, introducing a lot of new material in a short amount of time. These concepts are then consolidated through the homework sheets.

#### Session Recordings

The course content is found in five HTML presentations, one for each session, but there are recordings for every session of the tutor going through the slides. It is strongly advised to learn from these recordings as more information, context, and explanations are given than is provided in the slides alone.

#### Homework Notebooks

Every teaching session also has a homework notebook. These must be completed in their entirety for a participant to be eligable for a certificate of completion; in fact, completing the homework sheets is the _only_ requirement. Solutions for all questions are provided, but we will be looking out for plagarism so it is best not to copy answers.

#### Additional Notes

The occasional session includes a short recorded presentation offering additional notes. This content is not strictly necessary but is of great importance if you wish to use your R skills on practical projects in the future. 

The additional notes for session one are required if you wish to aquire a certificate of course completion from WDSS.

### Session Links

Here you can find the resources for each session. Sessions will be added as the course progresses.
